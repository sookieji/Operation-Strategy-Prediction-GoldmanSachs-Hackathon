# Operation-Strategy-Prediction-GoldmanSachs-Hackathon

The pandemic has had an overwhelming impact on the global economy, leading to short-term contractions and uncertainties in the long term. Our project talks about how Goldman Sachs could monitor the pre-pandemic and post-pandemic trends in inflation and consumer prices, and prepare to adjust their strategies accordingly, 
to remain competitive and profitable in a constantly changing economic landscape.

Based on the global analysis, the Americas would be a current market that could give the returns that are expected and for the future, Asia would be a market that Goldman Sachs could explore. 
The forecasted trends of Wealth Management indicate that this would be a segment that would yield a fruitful result. 
The predictions from the Service sector show that the returns from this segment seem positive on the whole. 
The trends forecasted for the Commodities sector also show that it is a segment that could give positive output on a long run
